# workout app and wendler cycle generator

This is just a little personal project I started to try making a PWA using indexedDB. It is a work in progress.

TODO: bar weight and plates need to come from settings.

TODO: split new wendler into two steps

TODO: add tabs to Exercise History

TODO: more stats on exercise view

TODO: auto open next wendler day.

TODO: non-wendler routines

TODO: if no wendler sets try to get form values from history

TODO: clean up useDB, that got out of hand ðŸ˜¬

TODO: icons and styles.

TODO: clean up preview, the two renders (sort by) are very annoying

TODO: aux exercise form errors.

TODO: delete aux when making new cycle

TODO: Super sets

TODO: connect to watch?
