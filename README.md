# workout app and wendler cycle generator

This is just a little personal project I started to try making a PWA using indexedDB. It is a work in progress.

TODO: change app name and logo, and favicon

TODO: Add ability to edit/duplicate wendler cycle.

TODO: Edit exercises - add exercise types, body weight, body weight + weight, time - allow multiple secondary muscle groups.

TODO: home screen menu?? (maybe as a fixed footer)

TODO: notes for day. (maybe by workout too, allowing for multiple workouts)

TODO: stats view.

TODO: change ux for super sets in wendler? Maybe add aux set, add super set?

TODO: back up settings

TODO: styles not loading when offline - probably also want to remove code splitting

TODO: finish cleaning up WendlerWorkout

TODO: Screen always on? (currently only in chrome 84)

TODO: Swipe on calendar view??

TODO: Calendar should fill first and last week with prev/next month days

TODO: clean up all naming conventions.

TODO: more stats on exercise view (Charts)

TODO: auto open next wendler day.

TODO: non-wendler routines

TODO: clean up useDB, that got out of hand ðŸ˜¬

TODO: wendler form errors

TODO: Super sets

TODO: connect to watch?

TODO: custom plate calculator settings per exercise (example on RDL I only want 25s and under)
