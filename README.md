# workout app and wendler cycle generator

This is just a little personal project I started to try making a PWA using indexedDB. It is a work in progress.

TODO: aux exercises need to link to exercise db

TODO: get PRs

TODO: backup solution.

TODO: share function

TODO: get initial values for maxes from PRs or previous cycle

TODO: clean up preview, the two renders (sort by) are very annoying

TODO: duplicate workouts

TODO: aux exercise form errors.

TODO: delete aux when making new cycle

TODO: allow free form sets at the end of wendler workout

TODO: in wendler view, mark week complete if all days are complete

TODO: Free workout.

TODO: connect to watch?
