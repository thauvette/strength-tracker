# workout app and wendler cycle generator

This is just a little personal project I started to try making a PWA using indexedDB. It is a work in progress.

TODO: view exercise history and get PRs

TODO: free workouts + allow free form sets at the end of wendler workout

TODO: icons and styles.

TODO: share function

TODO: clean up preview, the two renders (sort by) are very annoying

TODO: aux exercise form errors.

TODO: delete aux when making new cycle

TODO: Super sets

TODO: connect to watch?
